 **OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

**PROJECT : Machine learning model implementation**

**OBJECTIVE:**
  A machine learning model implementation project's goal is to use data-driven methods to tackle a particular problem. This entails gathering data, preparing it, and choosing a suitable model to train. Relevant indicators are used to assess the model's performance, and it is optimized for improved outcomes. After optimization, the model is put into practice and kept under constant observation. Providing precise forecasts or insights based on the data is the ultimate objective.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**
- **PYTHON :** Python is a high-level, easy-to-read programming language used for web development, data analysis, automation, and more.
- **VSCODE :** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight, open-source code editor with support for debugging, version control, and extensions
- **PANDAS :** Pandas is used for data analysis and manipulation, and it offers data structures like DataFrames to handle and analyze structured data effectively. It makes it simple to clean, transform, and explore data for activities involving analysis or machine learning.
-  **SCIKIT-LEARN(sklearn):** A machine learning library called Scikit-learn offers easy-to-use and effective tools for data mining and analysis. It contains tools for model evaluation and preprocessing as well as algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering.
-  **MATPLOTLIB :** Matplotlib is a plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It allows users to generate a wide variety of charts and graphs to visualize data insights effectively.
-  **SEABORN :** Seaborn is a Matplotlib-based data visualization library that offers a high-level interface for making visually appealing and educational statistics visualizations. It makes it easier to create intricate visualizations such as pair plots, box plots, and heatmaps.
